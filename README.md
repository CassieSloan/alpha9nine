## Instructions

### Quick start guide

1. Clone and install the repo
2. Register an account on Prismic
3. Configure your custom types
4. Create an API key and store it in an ENV variable
5. Go to your content tab
6. Create new documents for the `Page` type and fill out every input field
7. Your project is ready for development and production

## Setup

You have to know the basics of Prismic's interface in order to be able to make the necessary changes / setup your project accordingly. You can also checkout the document ["Sourcing from Prismic"](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/sourcing-from-prismic/).

### Create .env files

Use `.env.template` to generate `.env.development` and `.env.production` files containing the following ENV variables

#### SITE_URL

This is the frontend URL of your project, for development it will be http://localhost:8000 or similar

#### PRISMIC_REPO_NAME

Don't forget to change the default `PRISMIC_REPO_NAME` env variable. The `PRISMIC_REPO_NAME` is the name you have entered at the creation of the repository (youâ€™ll also find it as the subdomain in the URL)

#### API_KEY

You need to define the `API_KEY` for your Primis project. You can retrieve the key here:

- You can generate an access token in the **API & Security** section of your repository settings. Setting a **Callback URL** is not necessary.
- The token will be listed under "Permanent access tokens".


#### IS_STAGING

Specifies whether the site is in staging, setting this variable will ensure the site is not crawlable by search engines. Remove this variable if you are deploying to the production URL and you want the site indexed.

### Netlify

If you deploy to Netlify you will need to use their UI to create the above build variables. See instructions [here](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/#build-environment-variables)

## Development

**Before running the local development server you'll need to add content to your Prismic repository!**

**Please note**: You have to publish all these documents (not only saving them)!

After that you can run the local server:

```shell
npm run dev
```

### Adding new features/plugins

You can add other features by having a look at the official [plugins page](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/)

### Building your site

```shell
npm run build
```

Copy the content of the `public` folder to your webhost or use a website like Netlify which automates that for you.

## Configuration

You can configure your setup in `config/website`:

```JS
module.exports = {
  pathPrefix: '/', // Prefix for all links. If you deploy your site to example.com/portfolio your pathPrefix should be "portfolio"
